# The-Zoo

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This project was an app to manage zoo animals with the main goals or utilizing JNI for both Java and C++ and using inheritance to create a class hierarchy

•  What did you do particularly well? 

I created the class hierarchy utilizing virtual methods to create abstract classes and created the proper subclasses

•  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I believe the saving and loading file code in C++ could be enhanced by learning more about managing files in C++

•  Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? 
I found loading the text file into an array challenging but utilizing C++ documentation I was able to find a solution that I liked, I think this is an area that could be better but I believe it works for what the application was supposed to do


•  What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? 
Learning how to use JNI I think could be greatly useful for future projects 

•  How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
I added comments, utilized abstract classes, and created multiple methods. I think the code could be more modular with more time and classes.
